# Glowworm
Hey, my name is Vasya, and here is my project - Glowworm or "светялчок"
Idea of this project is very simple - device, that can feel when him 
pick up somebody and starts to glow in different colors slowly change it.
He can feel hands with big polygon and capacitive touch sense. To glow
his uses RGB led. To fabricate this project you can use gerber or photo
to fabricate with printer and photoresist or direct toner transfer to board
